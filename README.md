# üåç World Happiness Analysis (2015-2024)

A comprehensive data science project analyzing the World Happiness Report dataset to uncover insights about global well-being and the factors that contribute to national happiness levels.

## üìä Project Overview

This project explores a decade of happiness data from 150+ countries, investigating relationships between happiness scores and various socioeconomic indicators including GDP, life expectancy, social support, freedom, and trust levels.

### Key Questions Explored
- Which countries consistently rank highest and lowest in happiness?
- How has global happiness evolved over the past decade?
- What factors correlate most strongly with national happiness?
- Do wealthier countries always have happier populations?
- Which countries achieve high happiness despite lower GDP?
